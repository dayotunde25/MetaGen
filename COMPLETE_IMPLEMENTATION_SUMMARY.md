# 🎉 **COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**

## 🎯 **Your Requests: BOTH FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ Request 1: Auto-Generated Dataset Descriptions**
**"Can we make the description of a dataset be auto generated like what is contained in the dataset, what the dataset is about and what it can be used for. In case if a user does not provide enough and good details about the dataset, description should be generated automatically and added to the metadata"**
